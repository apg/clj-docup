# docup

docup is a very simple markup language that attempts to get rid of all the gobbledegock associated with something like Markdown. As a result there are very few operators, and nesting is not permitted within simple elements.

   `(some code)` => [:code "(some code)"]
   *some bold text* => [:b "some bold text"]
   /some italic text/ => [:i "some italic text"]
   _some underlined text_ => [:u "some underlined text"]

   `(some code _hello_)` => [:code "(some code _hello_)"]
